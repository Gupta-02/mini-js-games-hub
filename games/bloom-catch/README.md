Bloom Catch â€” Prototype

How to run
- Open `games/bloom-catch/index.html` in a browser (double-click or use Live Server extension).
- Mobile-first: try it on your phone or in Chrome DevTools (Toggle device toolbar).

What this prototype has
- Canvas-based falling petals with pastel colors
- Pointer/touch controls: drag/tilt the vase horizontally to catch petals
- Combo counter that grows the vase slightly when you catch repeatedly
- High score tracking with localStorage
- Misses counter; after 5 misses the game ends and you can restart
- Small WebAudio beeps for catch/miss (may require a first tap to enable audio)

Next steps (suggestions)
- Add artwork (SVG vase & petals)
- Add background ambient sound and volume control
- Smooth particle trails and subtle parallax
- Save high score locally
- Add accessibility (large buttons, sound toggle, haptics)
